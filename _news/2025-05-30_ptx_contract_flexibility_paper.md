Recently, our paper, titled **"Role of flexible contract design in unlocking power-to-x projects"** was presented by Jimmy Brossier at International Conference on the European Energy Market (EEM), 2025, held in Lisbon, Portugal from 27-29 May 2025.

Jimmy worked on this topic as his Master's thesis project at Technical University of Denmark (DTU), supervised by Lesia Mitridati in collaboration with myself and Tue Vissing Jensen from Vestas R&D. 

The resulting publication (referenced below) examines the role that flexibility designed into hydrogen offtake agreements could play in unblocking power-to-x projects. 

We often hear that *"green hydrogen is a dead-end"*. Indeed, such projects have suffered recent slowdown due to a number of geopolitical shifts impacting their financial viability. However, truth is that a 100% decarbonised society cannot exist without green hydrogen and its derivatives. 

With that in mind, the approach proposed in this work leverages advanced asset modeling and optimization to inform financial agreements that could potentially help improve the economic feasibility of such projects in the future.

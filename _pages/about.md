#### Hi and welcome!

I am a Researcher and recently started working as a Senior Quantitative Analyst at <a href="https://copenhagen-energytrading.com"> Copenhagen Energy Trading </a>. Until recently, I was working as Optimization Specialist in the R&D division at <a href="https://www.vestas.com/en"> Vestas Wind Systems </a> in Denmark after receiving my PhD degree from <a href="https://www.dtu.dk/english/">Technical University of Denmark (DTU)</a>. 

At Vestas, I developed algorithms for risk-aware participation of wind and wind-based hybrid power plants, e.g., power-to-x, in energy markets. During my PhD, I proposed novel market mechanisms and products for energy systems (electricity and gas) to better integrate weather-dependent renewable energy sources (solar, wind) into the energy markets. 

Previously, I co-founded a CleanTech startup, <a href="https://sharedelectric.com">Shared Electric</a>, based out of Zurich, Switzerland, where we built demand response solutions to accelerate the clean energy transition in Europe and India. 

I am passionate about writing on the topics of climate change, energy economics, and energy policy, with a specific focus on developing countries. My articles are published in <a href="https://medium.com/clean-energy-for-billions">Clean Energy for Billions</a>. 

As a person, I enjoy engaging in persuasive communication by effectively breaking down complex scientific ideas and in mentoring and inspiring colleagues. I thrive in uncertain, dynamic, and complex environments where I apply my skills to discover solutions that are novel, optimal, and compassionate, while balancing various constraints and viewpoints.

My core technical expertise lies in energy markets, stochastic optimization, game theory, probability and statistics, forecasting, product management, and software development. 

Research topics of current interest to me are data markets and value of information in energy markets, challenges at the intersection of AI and climate change, and bottlenecks to renewable energy projects. 

[At CET, I lead our efforts to maximize operational value of energy storage systems in energy markets to bring flexibility to support the clean energy transition.]: #
